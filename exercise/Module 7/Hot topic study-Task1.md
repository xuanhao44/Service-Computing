# Hot topic study – Task 1

Find several cases and research papers on the **use cases of service orientation in the chosen domain/industry** (what problems did companies in this industry have that were solved by applying service orientation; what was the service orientation used for, … ) 

By the end of March 26th, submit a table with the information you have found.

| Use case                                                     | Short description of the use case                            | Link to the website with the case description/research paper |

| **Example:**<br/>automatic route planning                    | Map services can be embedded in transportation software to add route planning capabilities. For example, UDK Weboffice is an enterprise software with a focus on optimized transportation. In this logistics software, Google Maps API was used to embed Google Map to automatically build optimal routes. | [Overview of map services that bring the whole world to the smartphone screen (clockwise.software)](https://clockwise.software/blog/overview-of-map-services-that-bring-the-whole-world-to-the-smartphone-screen/) |
| High-performance cloud computing for exhaustive protein-protein docking | This paper discusses the porting of MEGADOCK, a protein-protein interaction prediction software, to Microsoft Azure. The study constructed a cloud parallel computing environment with up to 1,600 CPU cores and 960 GPUs using four CPU instance types and two GPU instance types. The results showed strong scaling values for both CPU and GPU instances and demonstrated that using a GPU instance reduced computation time and cloud usage fees. The developed environment is highly portable and suitable for applications requiring an on-demand and large-scale HPC environment. | [High-performance cloud computing for exhaustive protein-protein docking (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08905) |
| A Generalized Flow for B2B Sales Predictive Modeling: An Azure Machine Learning Approach | This paper proposes a data-driven Machine Learning (ML) workflow on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Service (Azure ML) to forecast the outcome of business to business (B2B) sales. The workflow consists of two pipelines: an ML pipeline to train predictive models on historical sales data and a prediction pipeline to infer the likelihood of winning new sales opportunities. The effectiveness of the proposed workflow was evaluated on a real sales dataset of a major global B2B consulting firm and showed that decision-making based on the ML predictions is more accurate and brings a higher monetary value. | [A Generalized Flow for B2B Sales Predictive Modeling: An Azure Machine Learning Approach (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01441) |
| Facial Recognition Enabled Smart Door Using Microsoft Face API | This article discusses research on home security and IoT. It proposes a concept of a smart door that secures the entrance through facial recognition. The smart door uses an HD camera, display monitor, voice output and electromagnets controlled by a microcontroller. People can open the smart door through facial recognition and interact with it. Facial recognition is done through Microsoft’s Face API but our desktop application operating over Microsoft Visual Studio IDE reduces computational time. | [Facial Recognition Enabled Smart Door Using Microsoft Face API (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00498) |
| Analytical database PostgreSQL                               | It is important to store and use valuable game player behavior data properly. The storage of massive data and the timeliness of computing are two big challenges. Ustar uses Alibaba Cloud's mature analytical database products to help cope with the problems it faces. | [悠星网络基于阿里云分析型数据库 PostgreSQL 版的数据实践](https://my.oschina.net/u/3611008/blog/3085763) |
| Help with business                                           | Microsoft tools help companies run their business. These tools include Microsoft Security, Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams and Windows 365. | [Microsoft Customer Story-Mead Johnson accelerates multidimensional cloud migration, reinvents the value chain with Azure](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1580242342001115790-mjn-retailers-azure-infra) |
| Enterprise network security                                  | Blibli faced challenges from DDoS and bot attacks, they implemented Cloudflare solutions such as Magic Transit, Bot Management, and Zero Trust to secure their network, block malicious traffic, and enable remote work. With Cloudflare’s agile and user-friendly dashboard and support, Blibli improved their user experience, reduced infrastructure costs, and gained network visibility. | [Blibli Case Study Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/blibli/) |
