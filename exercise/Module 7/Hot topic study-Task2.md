# Hot topic study - Task 2

Find information online about the benefits of applying service orientation in the chosen domain/industry.

By the end of April 2nd, submit a table with the information you have found.

| Benefits | Short description of the benefits | Link to the website where the benefits are described/mentioned |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|          |                                   |                                                              |
|          |                                   |                                                              |
|          |                                   |                                                              |

Make sure that the links you include are valid.

## Example

Let's follow the example we used last time (please note, this is just an example, each student should find resources relevant to the industry selected by them).

You can search for 2 kinds of websites:

1. Websites that describe benefits of service orientation (for example cloud computing) in your industry in general.

2. Websites that describe specific use case and point out what benefits were observed in these cases.

**Industry: transportation**

| Benefits            | Short description of the benefits                            | Link to the website where the benefits are described/mentioned |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Improved efficiency | The company trucks usually have to deliver items to multiple locations, so the possibility to create optimized combined routes make the work of the logistics department more efficient. | https://clockwise.software/blog/overview-of-map-services-that-bring-the-whole-world-to-the-smartphone-screen/ |
|                     | Cloud computing has helped increase efficiency by automating key processes and eliminating the need for manual data entry in  logistics. For example, cloud-based transportation management systems can automatically generate shipping labels and track shipments in real-time. This visibility into the supply chain helps logistics managers make more informed decisions and avoid costly delays. | https://dfreight.org/blog/cloud-computing-benefits-for-logistics-industry/ |
| Lower cost          | Cloud computing helps with eliminating the need for expensive hardware and software. For example, cloud-based transportation management systems can help logistics companies plan and execute shipments more efficiently. This can lead to significant savings on fuel and labor costs. | https://dfreight.org/blog/cloud-computing-benefits-for-logistics-industry/ |

To make this task complete, you will need to find more sources and describe more benefits to the industry selected by you.

## Self

Industry: metro

| Use case                                                     | Short description of the use case                            | Link to the website with the case description/research paper |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use AI to help Track Abnormality Detection and Power Apps to develop a mature solution | Microsoft helped Tokyo Metro improve the quality of inspections by providing AI services and tools. Tokyo Metro used Microsoft Azure AI services and Microsoft Power Platform to create a solution that detects equipment deterioration and other abnormalities from images taken of railroad tracks. | [Microsoft Customer Story-Using Azure AI and Power Apps, Tokyo Metro Develops a Track Abnormality Detection Solution by Amateur and Pro Developers and Business Experts](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1584832935479879254-tokyo-metro-travel-transportation-azure-en-japan) |



| Benefits                          | Short description of the benefits                            | Link to the website where the benefits are described/mentioned |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Auto process(Improved efficiency) | Tokyo Metro has created an excellent detection model and classification model, as well as an application that calls the detection model and an application that determines normality/abnormality based on the classification model. However, handover from the detection model to the classification model had been performed by manually cropping images. | [Microsoft Customer Story-Using Azure AI and Power Apps, Tokyo Metro Develops a Track Abnormality Detection Solution by Amateur and Pro Developers and Business Experts](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1584832935479879254-tokyo-metro-travel-transportation-azure-en-japan) |
|                                   | It was very time-consuming to do this manually every time. Therefore, Microsoft created codes to automate this process, that is, linking everything together, so that the codes would be called from the application and output could be checked on the display screen. |                                                              |

I’d like to say that it has some other benefits, such as improving the quality of inspections and reducing the workload on employees. However, the former is ambiguous: AI only helps with some of the inspections and its accuracy still needs to be increased. I can't say that AI is definitely better than employees — the employees are still better in profession. The latter is the same as improving efficiency. Therefore, I only mentioned one benefit.
