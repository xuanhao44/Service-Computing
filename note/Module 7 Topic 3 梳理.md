## 7 Summary

- Standardization of cloud computing
  - Standards ensure that goods or services produced in a specific industry come with consistent quality
  - Many standards and specifications related to Cloud Computing have been developed by standards developing organizations
  - Foundational standards that deal with vocabulary and reference architecture are essential for developing other standards.
- Cloud Computing Reference Architecture
  - Cloud Computing Reference standard defines the basic building blocks—architectural elements and their relationships—which make up the cloud
  - Cloud computing reference models were proposed by multiple cloud organizations and standard setting bodies
- Cloud computing standards and laws in China
  - China has developed a number of standards and laws that regulate the adoption of cloud computing technology in different aspects (security, privacy, financial and others)
  - Chinese parties collaborate with international standard setting bodies
