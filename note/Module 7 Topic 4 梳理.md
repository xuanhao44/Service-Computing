Topic 4: Virtualization

[TOC]

## 1 Cloud Computing requirements

## 2 Virtualization definition

- Virtualization is the creation of a virtual (rather than physical) version of something, such as
  - an operating system
  - a server
  - a storage device
  - or network resources.
- It hides the physical characteristics of a resource from users, instead showing another abstract resource.

## 3 Virtualization Architecture

### 3.1 Virtual machine

Host vs guest

### 3.2 Virtualization platform

## 4 Virtualization – resource sharing and isolation

## 5 Benefits of Virtualization

## 6 Virtualization in Cloud Computing

Details about Server Virtualization in the slide.

## 8 Hypervisor Types

- Type 1 – Bare metal
  - Hypervisors run directly on the host's hardware as a hardware control and guest operating system monitor
- Type 2 – Hosted
  - Hypervisors are software applications running within a conventional operating system 

## 9 Containerization

OS level virtualization + Application level virtualization = Containerization

### 9.1 Containers

### 9.2 Types of containers

- OS containers
- Apps containers

### 9.3 Container management, orchestration, clustering

- Container orchestration or container management is mostly used in the context of application containers
- Implementations providing such an orchestration include **Kubernetes** and **Docker swarm** and others
  - Kubernetes
  - Docker swarm

## 10 Summary

Discuss virtualization and outline its role in enabling the cloud computing system model
